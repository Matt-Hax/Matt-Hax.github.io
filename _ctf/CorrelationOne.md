Theres nothing odd at first glance. No buttons to click on or anything to interact with. We can gather more information of the website by using <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSLLabs</a>. 
This site is a free online tool by Qualys that analyzes the SSL/TLS configuration of websites. It can be useful for OSINT since we can gather things like server IP's, hosting providor info, certificate issuer, and Comman Name & Alternative Name's. The last of which will help us out here. We find that the alternative name is definitelynotaflag.north.torbia. Definitely not suspicious...
