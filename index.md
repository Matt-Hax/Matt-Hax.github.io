# Hi, I'm Matt!

I'm a recent IT graduate with 4 years of experience in tech support. My interest in cybersecurity grew from hands-on work across different IT areas. 
I'm currently focused on Blue Team concepts and aiming to break into the SOC world as a Tier 1 Analyst. 
This page is where I document my journey from labs to writeups and notes.
